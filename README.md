## Overview

This project uses p5.js for canvas rendering and OpenLayers to create an interactive map. The application fetches real-time ISS position data from the Open Notify API and updates the map accordingly.

## Features

- Real-time tracking of the ISS on an interactive map.
- Map rendering using the MapTiler API.
- Simple and intuitive design.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
# clone the repo
$ https://github.com/Jagan-07/ISS-Tracker.git

# change the working directory to ISS-Tracker
$ cd ISS Tracker
```

1. Open index.html in your preferred web browser.

# How it Works
The application fetches real-time ISS position data and updates the map every second. The ISS marker is displayed on the map, providing a visual representation of its current location.

# Usage
* Upon opening the application in a web browser, you'll see a map with the current position of the ISS marked by an icon.
* The map updates the ISS position every second.
